                <p>
                    Hey hotties, it's another message from your favorite guy. Sorry, not Richard Segway, inventor of the segway; it's just me, Brennan. 
                    <br><br>

                    I have been working on building a lovely little reading nook for my dear friends. And boy oh boy is it taking forever. I have now told them twice that it's "only going to be a few more hours." I'm getting desperate, the work is not wmoving at the speed that I want, and 
                    I am beginning to think that they don't believe it will ever get done (this could be in my head). They keep saying things like "stop apologizing" and "it's really no trouble, we're in no rush", but I can read BETWEEN THE LINES.
                    <br><br>

                    So my life advice for anybody aspiring to not value their time and help their friends, don't promise anything. Say that it will take one thousand years. Say that the winds of time will sweep any remnant of you under mountains of sandy loam before this nook is done. 
                    Tell them that their great great great great grand-robot-children will LOVE this keepsake. 
                    <br><br>

                    Signing off, your friendly neighborhood slowpoke, 
                    <br><br>

                <h3>The floodwaters have decimated my basement</h3>
                <div class="post-meta">Posted on August 15th, 2025</div>
                <p>
                    I have been rocked by 3 inches of water in my basement. This is no cause for alarm as I have a contingency plan, standing in 3 inches of water and staring at it. 
                    Since this also didn't work, we were forced to remove all the tiles, mop everything, purchase a mongo dehumidifier (short out menards for having some, and I take that shoutout back for your political affiliations), and get to WORK
                    <br><br>

                    Needless to say I am tired. I am working on a project soon with my dear friend Hayden and I cannot wait to get that underway. Just gotta get through all the dumb stuff that Mother nature (that cruel temptress) has in store for me. 
                    <br><br>

                    Oh! Also! Mother Nature has taken my car! Rude! 
                    <br><br>

                    Signing off, your lover and handyman,

                <p>
                    Exciting news everyone. I have done electrical work in the basement. Several outlets and 
                    so many sconces (yeah that's right im a fancy man). And guess what? There is not one fire 
                    currently burning in the basement. If you need electrical work, I legally cannot help you
                    but I can put a bunch of wires all over your basement and maybe sometimes power will go through
                    them and to a thing you want and NOT the air or a flammable blanket.

                   A new year and a new me. Just kidding its the same old bullshit. I made a cool Matcha stand, and im going to be helping some friends with some projects (aka farming them for content). I am looking forward to posting more stuff here and becoming
                   so good at woodworking. 

                   Real talk though, I plan on fighting harder to stay out of time-sinks and doomscrolls. I am trying to make the choice that benefits my mental health. Am I succeeding? Absolutely not
